
## Technologies Used

1. **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, along with regular CSS.
2. **Google Firebase**: To store images.
3. **react-image-crop**: To crop images.
4. **uuid**: To create unique IDs for saving and fetching images.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a typical React app structure. Components are in the `src` folder. There are also `assets`,`subcomponents` and `utilities` folders with generic components for buttons, file inputs, and modals, all styled using Tailwind CSS.

**note** 
Since firebase is a free account, it doesnot allow to upload image with size more than 1 MB
